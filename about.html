<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

  "As a third-year Electrical Engineering student, I have always been fascinated by the intricacies of electrical systems and the impact they have on our daily lives. However, as I delved deeper into my studies, I discovered a new passion - coding. Despite being a newcomer to the world of programming, I am eager to explore this field further and unlock its vast possibilities.
  
  With a strong foundation in electrical engineering principles, I am excited to combine my knowledge with coding skills to create innovative solutions. I am aware that I have a lot to learn, but I am committed to dedicating time and effort to become proficient in programming.
  
  My goal is to leverage my electrical engineering background and coding skills to pursue a career in areas like embedded systems, control systems, or electronics design. I am excited about the prospect of working on projects that integrate hardware and software, and I am confident that my unique blend of skills will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to the field.
  
  I am ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with learning to code, and I am excited to see where this new passion takes me."
